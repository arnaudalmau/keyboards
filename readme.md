# Introduction
This is my personal repository (publicly shared) used to compile all my programmable keyboards' files, layouts, resources and whatnots I found useful.

## My Daily - BT60v2 by [Polarity Works](https://www.polarityworks.com/)
Yet not fully open-sourced / QMK supported (this is ZMK based), this programmable Bluetooth PCB has all requisites to become an _endgame_ for anyone looking for a 60% keyboard.
Features: programmable (drag&drop, ZMK based), _unlimited_ layers (only limited by the board memory), hotswap available, ANSI/ISO options, backlight and RGB underglow, BLE with an _endless_ battery, standard GH60 layout.

### The layout and layers

### Pros
- Programmable: drag&drop / UF2 bootloader.
- "Endless" battery: if you don't use BL/RGB it lasts literally months.
- Standard GH60 layout: fits in any cases, easy to find keycaps.
- Hotswap option for the lazy (like me).
- Solderable version available both in ISO/ANSI, allowing several customization options (1u backspace, split shift, etc.)
- Fairly cheap (60â‚¬ in Spain via [Eloquent Clicks](https://eloquentclicks.com/products/polarity-works-bt60-v2-wireless-pcb)).
- The Nordic Seminconductor BLE module allows it to work in metal cases.

### Cons
- Fairly fragile: some boards have suddenly died on me and no devices are able to recognize the board on Bluetooth mode
