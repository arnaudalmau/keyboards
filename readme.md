# Introduction
This is my personal repository (publicly shared) used to compile all my programmabe keyboards' files, layouts, resources and whatnots I found useful.

## My Daily - BT60 by [Polarity Works](https://www.polarityworks.com/)
Yet not fully open-sourced / QMK supported, this fully programmable Bluetooth PCB has all requisites to become an _endgame_ for anyone looking for a 60% keyboard.
Features: programmable (drag&drop), _unlimited_ layers (only limited by the board memory), hotswap available, ANSI/ISO, backlight, BLE with an _endless_ battery, standard GH60 layout.
